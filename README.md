## What's up, I'm IllusionMan1212 or Illusion for short.
---
I'm a web developer and software programmer interested in web technologies and game console emulation.

I'm also a **huge** open-source enthusiast and advocate.

#### Some personal info:

I'm 21 years old, I started taking interest in programming in late 2017 and I'm a big weeb lol.

If you'd like to support me financially you can buy me a coffee :). most funds will go towards my website domain name and server.
