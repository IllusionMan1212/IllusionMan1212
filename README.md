## What's up, I'm IllusionMan1212 or Illusion for short.
---
I'm a web developer and software developer interested in web technologies, I like to build stuff using Typescript, React, and Golang. Planning on learning flutter and taking android development more seriously in 2022.
I'm also a **huge** open-source enthusiast and advocate.

I'm 22 years old, I started taking interest in programming in late 2017.

If you'd like to donate you can do so here :).
